                ☛ Rani Lakshmi Bai, originally named Manikarnika Tambe, was born on November 19, 1828, in Varanasi. She
                was educated at home, learning horseback riding, sword fighting, and shooting, skills that would later
                define her as a warrior queen. <br><br>

                ☛ At the age of 14, Manikarnika was married to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao of Jhansi and took the name
                Lakshmi Bai. Despite her young age, she quickly took on the responsibilities of queen, becoming known
                for her strong will and leadership qualities. <br><br>

                ☛ Following the death of her husband, Rani Lakshmi Bai adopted a son, Damodar Rao, as her heir. However,
                the British East India Company refused to recognize the adoption and sought to annex Jhansi under the
                Doctrine of Lapse, leading to a conflict. <br><br>

                ☛ Refusing to surrender her kingdom, Rani Lakshmi Bai took charge of Jhansi's defenses. She personally
                led her troops into battle, becoming a symbol of resistance against British colonial rule. Her courage
                and determination rallied the people of Jhansi to her cause. <br><br>

                ☛ Rani Lakshmi Bai formed and trained an army that included both men and women, breaking traditional
                gender roles. Her leadership during the 1857 Indian Rebellion was marked by several successful battles
                against the British forces, making her a revered figure in Indian history. <br><br>

                ☛ One of the most famous episodes of her life was her daring escape from Jhansi. With her young son tied
                to her back, Rani Lakshmi Bai leaped on horseback from the fort of Jhansi, evading British capture. This
                act of bravery has become legendary. <br><br>

                ☛ Despite relentless pressure from the British, Rani Lakshmi Bai continued to fight for her kingdom and
                her people. She was martyred on June 18, 1858, in the battle of Gwalior, fighting valiantly until the
                end. Her death marked a significant moment in India's struggle for independence. <br><br>

                ☛ Rani Lakshmi Bai's legacy endures as a symbol of courage, resistance, and the fight for freedom. She
                remains an inspiration for generations, her life and deeds celebrated in Indian folklore, literature,
                and popular culture. <br><br>
